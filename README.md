This code defines functions for addition (`add`), subtraction (`subtract`), multiplication (`multiply`), and division (`divide`). The `calculator` function continuously prompts the user to select an operation and performs the corresponding calculation based on user input. It handles division by zero by checking if the divisor (`y`) is zero before performing the division.

To use this calculator, simply run the Python script. It will display a menu where you can choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for add, 2 for subtract, etc.).

1. User Interface
   Main Menu: The calculator starts with a menu displaying options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exiting the program.
   Input Handling: Uses Scanner class to accept user input for operation choice and operands (numbers).
   Operation Selection: Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and displays the result.
2. Arithmetic Operations
   Methods: Separate methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are defined to encapsulate each arithmetic operation.
   Error Handling: Handles division by zero scenario by checking the divisor and displaying an error message.
3. Looping and Exiting
   While Loop: The program runs in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit (choice == 5).
   Closing Resources: Uses scanner.close() to release resources after the user exits the program.
4. Usage
   Running the Program: Compile the Java file (javac SimpleCalculator.java) and run the compiled program (java SimpleCalculator).
   Interaction: Enter a choice from the menu, followed by the numbers for the chosen operation.
5. Extensions
   Expand Functionality: Add more operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
   User Interface Improvement: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing for a more interactive experience.
This simple calculator serves as a basic foundation that can be expanded and enhanced based on specific requirements or additional features desired.
