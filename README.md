This code defines functions for addition (`add`), subtraction (`subtract`), multiplication (`multiply`), and division (`divide`). The `calculator` function continuously prompts the user to select an operation and performs the corresponding calculation based on user input. It handles division by zero by checking if the divisor (`y`) is zero before performing the division.

To use this calculator, simply run the Python script. It will display a menu where you can choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for add, 2 for subtract, etc.).
